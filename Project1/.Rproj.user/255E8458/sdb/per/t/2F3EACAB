Overall response rate of the survey was $6.72\\%$ (1,950 out of 29,000). The response rate is slightly lower than the average response rate for external surveys which is around 10-15\\%. Out of 1,950 respondents, 76 of them reported to have had a concussion during since starting college. We analyzed this subset to investigate the factors that might influence ``self-reporting'' of concussion and the reasons why they may have occurred. \n\n<<echo=FALSE>>=\n########################################################################\n## Get data for Project 1\n## Analyze Project 1 question\n########################################################################\nrm( list = ls( all.names = TRUE ) )\nrm( list = objects( all.names = TRUE ) )\n\n########################################################################\n## Load header files and source functions\n########################################################################\nlibrary( ggplot2 )\nlibrary( RFunctionsSN )\nlibrary( xtable )\n\n########################################################################\n## Command line arguments for some static variables\n########################################################################\nProjectPath <- '~/Stat/Stat_Consulting/TraciSnedden/Project1/'\n#ProjectPath <- '~/Documents/snandi/Stat/Stat_Consulting/TraciSnedden/Project1/'\n\nDataPath <- paste0( ProjectPath, 'Data/' )\nfileNameData <- 'InjuryDataFinal_TotalDays.csv'\nfileNameCodedData <- 'DataCoded.RData'\n\nsource( 'Codebook.R' )\nsource( 'Project1_Static.R' )\n\n########################################################################\n\n########################################################################\n## Functions\n########################################################################\ngetCodedData <- function( folderPath, fileName ){\n  filePath <- paste0( folderPath, fileName )\n  load( filePath )\n  return( DataCoded )\n}\n\ngetProject1Data <- function( folderPath, fileName ){\n  DataCoded <- getCodedData( folderPath, fileName )\n  DataProject1 <- DataCoded[, Project1_VarNames ]\n  colnames( DataProject1 ) <- Project1_VarRenames\n  DataProject1 <- subset( DataProject1, InjuryType == 'Concussion' )\n  DataProject1$InjuryType <- NULL\n  return( DataProject1 )\n}\n\n\n########################################################################\n## Data\n########################################################################\nDataProject1 <- getProject1Data( folderPath = DataPath, fileName = fileNameCodedData )\nDataProject1NoNA <- subset( DataProject1, !is.na( as.vector( ReportedConcussion ) ) )\nDataProject1NoNA$ReportedConcussion <- as.factor( as.vector( DataProject1NoNA$ReportedConcussion ) )\n@\n\\subsubsection*{Summary}\nOf the 76 students who had concussion, the only 31 ``self-reported'', as shown in table \\ref{tab:tab1Summary}.\n<<echo=FALSE, results=tex>>=\nprint( xtable( t( table( DataProject1$ReportedConcussion ) ), caption = \"Self-reporting of concussion\", label = \"tab:tab1Summary\" ), include.rownames = FALSE )\n@\n\nThe plot (fig \\ref{fig:Fig1Age}) below shows the distribution of ages of students in the three sub-groups - \"YES\", \"NO\" and Missing information\n\n<<echo=FALSE>>=\nPlot1Age <- qplot() + geom_boxplot( aes( x = ReportedConcussion, y = Age, fill = ReportedConcussion ), \n                                    data = subset( DataProject1NoNA, Age < 35 ) ) +\n  theme( legend.position = 'top', \n         panel.background  = element_rect( fill = \"white\", colour = NA ),\n         panel.border      = element_rect( fill = NA, colour = \"grey50\" ),\n         panel.grid.major  = element_line( colour = \"grey80\", size = 0.2 ),\n         panel.grid.minor  = element_line( colour = \"grey95\", size = 0.5 )\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual( breaks = c( \"NO\", \"YES\" ), values = c( \"red\", \"gray\" ) ) +\n  ylab( label = 'Age' )\nfilenamePlot <- 'Plot1Age.png'\nggsave( filename = filenamePlot, plot = Plot1Age, device = 'png', width = 5, height = 3 )\nfilenamePlot <- 'Plot1Age.pdf'\nggsave( filename = filenamePlot, plot = Plot1Age, device = 'pdf', width = 5, height = 3 )\n@\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\linewidth]{Plot1Age.pdf}\n\\caption{Distribution of Age of students who had concussion, separated by whether they self-reported or not}\n\\label{fig:Fig1Age}\n\\end{figure}\nFigure \\ref{fig:Fig1Age} excludes one student whose age was 37 in the \"YES\" category.

Two predictor variables - age of student and gender of student, were used in the analysis, with simultaneous entry of predictors. As shown in table \\ref{tab:Tab8}, the overall predictive model was statistically significant (likelihood ratio chi-square = 10.15 [4], p < 0.05). The independent variables age and the interaction of age with gender were both significant in predicting the likelihood of self-reporting. On an average, older students were more likely to self-report. Females, on an average, were more likely to self-report. However, older males were less likely to self-report (OR = -2.19). Although the overall model and the two predictors were statistically significant, the classification results indicated modest success, with an overall rate of correct classification of 64.71\\%. The overall effect size was also modest, with the Nagelkerke R$^2$ equal to 10.83\\%.\n\n<<echo=FALSE, results=tex>>=\n####################################################################\n## New output table format\n####################################################################\nSummary <- summary( Model2 )$coefficients\n\nTable1 <- cbind( col1 = paste0( round( Summary[,'Estimate'], 2 ), ' (', round( Summary[,'Std.

For males, the odds of self-reporting was 0.363 (log odds = -1.012) compared to females, although the p-value was large. This was possibly due to the imbalance in the data (50 females vs 18 males). The interaction term between age and gender was -1.03 (p-value < 0.05), which implied that for males, the odds of self reporting reduces by 0.356 for every one year of age. This was consistent with the pattern in figure \\ref{fig:Fig3AgeGender}. The prediction model can be used for prediction: the probability of a 18 year old female to self-report was 20\\%, and male was 47\\%. But for a 22 year old female it was 78\\%, but male was 17\\%. \n\n\\subsubsection*{Limitations}\nThe summary and statistical findings, although interesting, have some limitations. The sample size was 76, and out of them 8 students did not respond to the question on self-reporting, further reducing the sample size to 68 students. Further analysis is necessary to assert if these non-respondents could be asserted as \"missing-at-random\". More respondents with information like the reason for injury, their activities, etc, would improve the predictive power of this model. A more balanced sample, in terms of the predictors would improve the robustness of the results. For example, if more males responded to the survey it would improved the gender balance. \n\n\\end{document}\n",
